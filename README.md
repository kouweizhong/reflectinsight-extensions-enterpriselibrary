## Overview ##

The Enterprise Library extension supports v6.0 and v5.0 of the Logging Application Block. However if you need to support an older version, then you will need to download the ReflectInsight Logging Extensions Library source from GitHub and rebuild it against a specific release of the Enterprise Library. 

## Benefits of ReflectInsight Extensions ##

The benefits to using the Insight Extensions is that you can easily and quickly add them to your applicable with little effort and then use the ReflectInsight Viewer to view your logging in real-time, allowing you to filter, search, navigate and see the details of your logged messages.

### Specific to Enterprise Library ###

One of the nice benefits of using the Enterprise Library extension is that if your message you log is XML, then the extension will automatically transform your message into the SendXML message type which will show up in the XML syntax.
